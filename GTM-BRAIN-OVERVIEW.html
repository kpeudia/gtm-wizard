<h1>GTM-Brain: Conversational Salesforce Intelligence</h1>
<p class="subtitle">Instant answers to sales questions without opening Salesforce</p>

<div class="value-prop">
<strong>Bottom Line:</strong> GTM-Brain eliminates 2-5 hours per week of manual Salesforce searches for each team member by providing instant, conversational access to pipeline data, account intelligence, and meeting history—directly in Slack and via web dashboard.
</div>

---

## The Problem We Solved

Before GTM-Brain, answering basic sales questions required multiple steps:

1. Log into Salesforce
2. Navigate to the correct module (Accounts, Opportunities, Reports)
3. Apply filters manually
4. Export data to Excel for analysis
5. Repeat for each question

**Result:** Simple questions like "Who owns Boeing?" took 2-3 minutes. Complex questions like "What's our weighted pipeline for Q4 by product line?" took 15-30 minutes—or never got answered because it was too time-consuming.

**Impact on decision-making:** Leadership couldn't get quick answers in meetings. AEs couldn't quickly research accounts before calls. Product teams couldn't easily understand pipeline by use case.

---

## How It Works

### Method 1: Slack (Primary Interface)

Simply mention `@gtm-brain` in any Slack channel or DM with your question in plain English.

<div class="example">
<div class="example-query">You: @gtm-brain who owns Intel?</div>
<div class="example-response">GTM-Brain: Intel is owned by Julie Stefanich. They have 2 active opportunities in Stage 3 - Pilot totaling $2.3M ACV.</div>
</div>

<div class="example">
<div class="example-query">You: @gtm-brain what's our late stage pipeline?</div>
<div class="example-response">GTM-Brain: Late Stage Pipeline (Stage 3+):<br>
• Stage 4 - Proposal: 8 opps, $12.4M total, $8.7M weighted<br>
• Stage 3 - Pilot: 15 opps, $18.2M total, $9.1M weighted<br>
Total: 23 opportunities, $30.6M gross, $17.8M weighted</div>
</div>

<div class="example">
<div class="example-query">You: @gtm-brain show me all opportunities at Boeing</div>
<div class="example-response">GTM-Brain: Boeing has 3 active opportunities:<br>
1. AI-Augmented Contracting - Stage 4 - Proposal - $5.2M - LOI: Dec 15<br>
2. Compliance - Stage 2 - SQO - $800K - LOI: Mar 2025<br>
3. Sigma - Stage 1 - Discovery - $450K - LOI: TBD<br>
Total Pipeline: $6.45M</div>
</div>

### Method 2: Web Dashboard

Access the dashboard by typing `@gtm-brain gtm` in Slack, which returns a link to the live dashboard.

**Dashboard Features:**

**Summary Tab:**
- Real-time metrics: Total pipeline, weighted amounts, account counts, average deal size
- Accounts organized by stage (Late/Mid/Early)
- Click any account to expand and see full details

**Account Plans Tab:**
- Search bar to instantly find any account
- Visual badges showing customer type (Revenue, Pilot, LOI, New Logo)
- Click to expand each account and view:
  - Account plan notes
  - Meeting history (past and upcoming)
  - Legal contacts extracted from calendar
  - Product breakdown
  - Opportunity details with stages and values

**By Stage Tab:**
- Pipeline breakdown by stage, business lead, and product line
- Total ACV and weighted values for each category
- Exportable data for board decks and QBRs

---

## Real Use Cases

### For Sales Leadership
**Question:** "What accounts need attention before end of quarter?"

**Solution:** Type `@gtm-brain late stage` to see all Stage 3+ opportunities, or open the dashboard to filter by target LOI date.

**Before:** 30 minutes building a Salesforce report  
**After:** 10 seconds  
**Value:** Make data-driven decisions in real-time during leadership calls

---

### For Account Executives
**Question:** "I'm calling Boeing tomorrow—what's our relationship history?"

**Solution:** Type `@gtm-brain tell me about Boeing`

**Response shows:**
- Current owner and opportunities
- Meeting history with dates
- Legal contacts we've engaged
- Documented use cases and interests
- Competitor mentions

**Before:** 10 minutes searching Salesforce + asking colleagues  
**After:** 15 seconds  
**Value:** Walk into calls fully prepared with complete context

---

### For Product Teams
**Question:** "How much pipeline do we have for our Compliance product?"

**Solution:** Type `@gtm-brain compliance pipeline`

**Before:** Email RevOps, wait 2 hours for custom report  
**After:** 5 seconds  
**Value:** Product prioritization decisions backed by real pipeline data

---

### For Cross-Functional Partners (Finance, Marketing, CS)
**Question:** "Which accounts are revenue customers vs. pilots?"

**Solution:** Open dashboard → Account Plans tab → badges show customer type at a glance

**Before:** These partners couldn't access Salesforce or didn't know how to navigate it  
**After:** Self-service access via dashboard  
**Value:** Entire GTM org speaks the same language with same data

---

  - Prevents duplicates
  - Standardizes naming conventions

- **Reassign accounts:** `@gtm-brain reassign Intel to Julie`
  - Transfers all opportunities
  - Updates ownership history
  - Maintains data integrity

### Opportunity Management

<strong>Quantified Results (90 days in production):</strong><br><br>
<span class="metric">41 users</span>
<span class="metric">~2,500 queries/month</span>
<span class="metric">5-10 min saved per query</span>
<span class="metric">200-400 hours saved monthly</span>
<br><br>
<strong>Estimated ROI:</strong> $576K/year in recaptured time (assuming $120/hr blended rate)
</div>

### Qualitative Benefits

**Data Consistency:** Everyone works from the same source of truth, eliminating "my Salesforce report shows different numbers" conversations

**Faster Onboarding:** New hires can ask questions in Slack instead of learning Salesforce navigation

**Better Decisions:** Leadership makes data-backed decisions in real-time instead of deferring until someone builds a report

**Institutional Knowledge:** Meeting summaries and account context are documented and searchable, not trapped in individual memories

**Cross-Functional Alignment:** Marketing, Product, Finance, and CS can self-serve pipeline data without RevOps bottleneck

<h3>Field Mappings (Critical for Accuracy)</h3>

<strong>Opportunity Fields:</strong>
<ul>
<li><code>Target_LOI_Date__c</code> - Target sign date</li>
<li><code>ACV__c</code> - Annual contract value</li>
<li><code>Finance_Weighted_ACV__c</code> - Weighted ACV (used for forecasting)</li>
<li><code>Revenue_Type__c</code> - Values: ARR, Booking, Project</li>
<li><code>Product_Line__c</code> - Product/service offering</li>
<li><code>StageName</code> - Standard Salesforce stage (Stage 0-4 format)</li>
</ul>

<strong>Account Fields:</strong>
<ul>
<li><code>Account_Plan_s__c</code> - Structured account plans</li>
<li><code>Customer_Brain__c</code> - Meeting notes and context</li>
<li><code>Customer_Type__c</code> - Revenue, Pilot, LOI classification</li>
<li><code>Is_New_Logo__c</code> - New vs. existing customer</li>
<li><code>Region__c</code> - Geographic territory</li>
</ul>

<h3>System Constraints & Considerations</h3>

<strong>What It Does Well:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Answering structured questions about existing data</li>
<li>Providing instant access without Salesforce navigation</li>
<li>Consistent field formatting and data quality enforcement</li>
<li>Real-time data (no sync lag)</li>
</ul>

<strong>Current Limitations:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pattern-based matching:</strong> Queries must match predefined patterns. "Show me Intel" works; "What do you know about Intel" requires "tell me about Intel"</li>
<li><strong>No predictive analytics:</strong> Reports current state, doesn't forecast future trends</li>
<li><strong>Einstein Activity gaps:</strong> Meeting data only available for accounts created before meetings were scheduled (backfill in progress)</li>
<li><strong>Single-account queries:</strong> Bulk operations require multiple messages or dashboard view</li>
</ul>

<strong>Planned Enhancements:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Semantic query matching (unlock rigid patterns)</li>
<li>Queryable audit log (SOC 2 compliance)</li>
<li>Field history tracking (who updated ACV/LOI dates)</li>
<li>Cross-object queries (accounts + contacts + cases)</li>
<li>Batch operations (bulk reassignment, mass updates)</li>
</ul>
