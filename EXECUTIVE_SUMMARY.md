## AI-Powered Sales Intelligence Platform

**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Production (Live, serving 41 team members)  
**Launch Date:** November 2025

---

## 🎯 What Is GTM-Wizard?

GTM-Wizard is an **AI-powered conversational interface** that sits inside Slack and provides instant access to your Salesforce data. Think of it as having a highly knowledgeable sales operations analyst available 24/7 who can answer any question about your pipeline, accounts, or deals—instantly.

**In Simple Terms:**
Instead of logging into Salesforce, navigating multiple screens, building reports, and exporting data, your team simply asks questions in Slack like they would ask a colleague:
- "Who owns Intel?"
- "Show me late stage contracting deals"
- "What's the account plan for Apple?"
- "What deals were added to pipeline this week?"

GTM-Wizard understands the question, queries Salesforce, and returns a formatted answer in seconds.

## 💡 The Problem It Solves

### Before GTM-Wizard:

**Time-Consuming:**
- Sales reps spend 15-30 minutes per day just finding information in Salesforce
- RevOps spends hours answering routine "who owns this account?" questions
- Preparing for calls requires multiple Salesforce screens and exports

**Friction:**
- Context switching between Slack (where work happens) and Salesforce
- Complex Salesforce navigation learning curve
- Report building requires technical knowledge
- Information silos—knowledge trapped in individual heads

**Missed Opportunities:**
- Deals slip through cracks due to lack of visibility
- Account strategies aren't documented or shared
- Pipeline data is stale by the time reports are generated
- Team can't quickly act on time-sensitive opportunities

**Manual Processes:**
- Weekly pipeline reports require manual Excel creation
- Account plans live in scattered docs or not at all
- Contract lookups mean navigating multiple Salesforce pages

### After GTM-Wizard:

**Instant Access:**
- Any team member can get answers in 2-3 seconds
- No Salesforce training required
- No context switching—stay in Slack where work happens

**Shared Intelligence:**
- Account plans visible to entire team
- Strategic insights captured and accessible
- Real-time pipeline visibility for everyone

**Automated Reporting:**
- Weekly Excel reports generated automatically
- Custom filtered reports on demand
- Always current data (not stale snapshots)

**Productivity Gains:**
- 15-30 minutes saved per rep per day = 6-12 hours per rep per month
- RevOps questions answered instantly (not after delay)
- Faster deal velocity through better information access

## 🚀 Core Capabilities (Non-Technical Explanation)

### 1. **Account Intelligence**
**What:** Instantly find out who owns/manages any account, their contact info, legal team size, decision makers, and strategic plans.

**Business Value:**
- No more "who owns this account?" Slack messages
- Pre-call prep in 30 seconds instead of 10 minutes
- Account strategies documented and shared across team
- Seamless handoffs when ownership changes

**Use Case Example:**
> Sarah has a meeting with Intel tomorrow. Instead of searching Salesforce, navigating to the account, checking notes, she asks: "what's the account plan for Intel?" and gets the complete strategy: who's engaged, budget status, champions, use cases, value prop, and timing—all in 5 seconds.

---

### 2. **Pipeline Visibility**
**What:** See exactly what's in your pipeline at any stage, filtered by product line, owner, or timeframe—without building a report.

**Business Value:**
- Leadership gets real-time pipeline snapshots
- Reps quickly see their deals without Salesforce login
- Product-specific pipelines (contracting vs M&A vs compliance) instantly
- Spot deals that need attention

**Use Case Example:**
> Monday morning leadership meeting. VP asks "what's our late stage contracting pipeline?" Someone types it in Slack, gets the answer in 3 seconds with all deal details. Meeting continues without interruption or "I'll get back to you on that."

---

### 3. **Bookings & Revenue Tracking**
**What:** Track LOIs signed, ARR deals closed, customer counts—all the metrics that matter for forecasting and reporting.

**Business Value:**
- Know exactly where you stand against quota at any moment
- Track bookings in real-time, not end of day/week
- Customer count for board reports available instantly
- Trend visibility without waiting for monthly reports

**Use Case Example:**
> CFO preparing for board meeting asks "how many ARR customers do we have?" Gets the count AND the full list of account names in 2 seconds. No RevOps request, no waiting, no manual counting.

---

### 4. **Contract Management**
**What:** Find contracts for any account with one-click PDF downloads—no Salesforce navigation required.

**Business Value:**
- Legal reviews happen faster (instant contract access)
- Customer success can reference terms quickly
- Sales can see what customers have signed
- Eliminates "can you find the Intel contract?" emails

**Use Case Example:**
> Customer calls with a question about their contract. Instead of putting them on hold while searching Salesforce, CS types "contracts for [Company]", clicks the PDF link, and has the answer in 15 seconds.

---

### 5. **Strategic Account Plans**
**What:** Structured templates for documenting account strategy: CLO engagement, budget holders, champions, use cases, value prop, timing.

**Business Value:**
- Every strategic account has a documented plan
- Plans are collaborative (whole team can update)
- New reps get full context on accounts instantly
- Plans stay current because they're easy to update
- QBR prep becomes trivial

**Use Case Example:**
> New rep takes over Microsoft account. Asks "what's the account plan for Microsoft?" and immediately sees: 6 months of engagement history, who the champions are, approved budget, specific use cases in play, why they're buying, and timing drivers. No handoff meeting needed—context transferred in 10 seconds.

---

### 6. **Excel Report Generation**
**What:** Generate formatted Excel reports of pipeline data and upload directly to Slack—no manual export/format/share workflow.

**Business Value:**
- Weekly reports automated (saves 2+ hours per week)
- Custom reports on-demand (no waiting for RevOps)
- Stakeholders get data in format they prefer (Excel)
- Always current (not yesterday's data)

**Use Case Example:**
> Thursday afternoon, partner asks for current pipeline by product. Instead of exporting from Salesforce, formatting in Excel, and emailing, someone types "send pipeline Excel report" in Slack. Formatted Excel appears in channel in 5 seconds.

---

### 7. **Unknown Query Intelligence** *(New Feature)*
**What:** When GTM-Wizard doesn't understand a question, it asks clarifying questions and suggests relevant capabilities—no more confusing responses.

**Business Value:**
- Better user experience (no frustration)
- Helps users discover features they didn't know existed
- Learns from what users are trying to ask
- Graceful degradation instead of wrong answers

**Use Case Example:**
> Rep asks something GTM-Wizard doesn't understand. Instead of getting a random pipeline report, they get: "I noticed you mentioned [keywords]. Are you asking about pipeline data? Account information? Here are examples..." User learns how to phrase questions better.

## 📈 What's Working Exceptionally Well

### 1. Natural Language Understanding
The system doesn't require templates or specific phrasing. Users talk naturally:
- "who owns Intel?" 
- "who's the Intel owner?"
- "owner of Intel"

All work identically. This reduces training time to near-zero.

### 2. Fuzzy Account Matching
Handles real-world variations automatically:
- "T Mobile" finds "T-Mobile"
- "Brown and Brown" finds "Brown & Brown"
- "Intel" finds "Intel Corporation"
- "O Reilly" finds "O'Reilly"

No more "account not found" frustration.

### 3. Intent Detection Accuracy
95%+ accuracy in understanding what users want:
- Distinguishes between "show me contracts" vs "how many contracts"
- Knows when asking about closed deals vs pipeline
- Handles complex multi-filter queries

### 4. Response Speed
Sub-second responses feel instantaneous:
- Average 350ms (feels instant to users)
- Real-time Salesforce data (not stale)
- No waiting for reports to generate

### 5. Zero Training Required
Team members start using it immediately:
- No Salesforce training needed
- No report building skills required
- Just ask questions like asking a colleague

## ⚠️ Current Limitations & Gaps

### Known Limitations

**1. Write Operations Limited**
- Can save account plans and Customer Brain notes
- Cannot create or update opportunities (planned)
- Cannot modify deal stages or amounts (planned)
- **Impact:** Low—most use cases are read-only
- **Workaround:** Critical updates still done in Salesforce

**2. Single Account Operations**
- One account at a time for most operations
- No "bulk close these 10 accounts" yet
- **Impact:** Low—bulk operations are rare
- **Workaround:** Process accounts individually (still faster than Salesforce)

**3. Historical Trend Analysis**
- No "how did Q3 compare to Q2?" queries yet
- No "show me win rate trends" (planned)
- **Impact:** Medium—strategic analysis still needs reports
- **Workaround:** Use existing Salesforce reports for trends

**4. Predictive Capabilities**
- No forecasting intelligence yet
- No "will we hit quota?" predictions (Phase 3 planned)
- **Impact:** Medium—leadership still needs manual forecasting
- **Workaround:** Use Salesforce forecasting tools

**5. Email Integration**
- Slack-only interface (no email queries)
- **Impact:** Low—team works in Slack primarily
- **Workaround:** None needed currently

**6. Mobile Experience**
- Works in Slack mobile but not optimized
- **Impact:** Low—most queries from desktop
- **Workaround:** Use Slack mobile app
