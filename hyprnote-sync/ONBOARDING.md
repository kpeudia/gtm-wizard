- Meeting notes become **Events** on the Account
- Key insights update the **Customer Brain** field
- Everything is attributed to you

---

## For New Reps: Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Install Prerequisites

**A. Install Node.js** (if not already installed)
1. Go to https://nodejs.org/
2. Download and install the LTS version (18+)
3. Verify: Open Terminal and run `node --version`

**B. Install Hyprnote**
1. Go to https://hyprnote.com/
2. Download and install the macOS app
3. Launch Hyprnote and sign in
4. Connect your calendar (Outlook/Google) in Hyprnote settings

### Step 2: Get the Sync Tool

Your admin will provide you with the `hyprnote-sync` folder.

1. Copy the folder to your computer (e.g., Documents)
2. Open Terminal
3. Navigate to the folder:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Documents/hyprnote-sync
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Step 3: Configure Your Profile

Run the setup wizard:
```bash
npm run setup
```

You'll need:
- Your name and email
- Your Salesforce User ID (ask your admin)

### Step 4: Record Meetings

1. Open Hyprnote before your meeting
2. Click "New Note" → "Record"
3. Hyprnote captures audio and generates notes
4. Stop recording when the meeting ends

### Step 5: Sync to Salesforce

After your meetings, run:
```bash
npm run sync
```

The tool will:
1. Find new recordings (not yet synced)
2. Match each meeting to a Salesforce Account
3. Create an Event with your notes
4. Update the Customer Brain field

## How Matching Works

The sync uses these methods to find the right Account (in order):

| Method | Confidence | How It Works |
|--------|------------|--------------|
| Calendar Email | 95% | Looks up attendee email → finds Contact → gets Account |
| Participant Email | 90% | Same, but from Hyprnote participant list |
| Company Name | 75% | Fuzzy matches participant company to Account name |
| Meeting Title | 60% | Extracts company from titles like "Acme Corp Demo" |

**Best practice:** Add external participants in Hyprnote with their email addresses for reliable matching.

## Daily Workflow

```

  └── Connect calendar (auto-populated meetings)

Before each call:
  ├── Click "New Note" 
  └── Click "Record"

After each call:
  └── Stop recording (notes auto-generate)

End of day:
  ├── Open Terminal
  ├── cd ~/Documents/hyprnote-sync
  └── npm run sync
```

## What Gets Created in Salesforce

### Event Record
- **Subject:** Meeting title from Hyprnote
- **Description:** Full meeting notes (cleaned and formatted)
- **Start/End Time:** Actual meeting time
- **Linked To:** Matched Account (and Contact if found)
- **Owner:** You (your SF User ID)

### Customer Brain Update
- Prepends to the Account's `Customer_Brain__c` field
- Includes: Date, rep name, duration, participants, notes summary
- Most recent meetings appear first

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No account match found"
The sync couldn't identify which Account this meeting belongs to.
- Add participant emails in Hyprnote before recording
- Or manually add the meeting in Salesforce

### "Salesforce connection failed"
- Check your internet connection
- Verify credentials in `data/config.json`
- Contact your admin if issues persist

### "Hyprnote database not found"
- Ensure Hyprnote is installed
- Record at least one meeting first
- Check the path in config matches your Hyprnote installation

### Meeting already synced
Each meeting is tracked to prevent duplicates. To re-sync:
1. Open `data/synced-sessions.json`
2. Remove the session entry
3. Run `npm run sync` again

## FAQ

**Q: Can I edit notes before syncing?**
A: Notes are pulled directly from Hyprnote. Edit them in Hyprnote first.

**Q: What if I record a personal call by mistake?**
A: If it doesn't match an Account, it won't sync. You can also delete sessions from Hyprnote.

**Q: How far back does it sync?**
A: Last 7 days by default. Older meetings are ignored.

**Q: Can I sync on my phone?**
A: Not currently. The sync runs on your Mac.

**Q: What if two people record the same meeting?**
A: Both will sync - Salesforce will have two Events. Coordinate with your team.
